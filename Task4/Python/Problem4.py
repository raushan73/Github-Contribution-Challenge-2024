'''
Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.

Example 1:
Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"

Example 2:
Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
 

Constraints:
1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104
a and b consist only of '0' or '1' characters.
Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.

#Given code has used type conversion for solution come up with a code that not uses type conversion.
#You need to correct complete function body.
#Do not change class name and method name.
